#Creating a flask web application

# now we are going to make sure that we create a predict api so for creating predict api i am just create an api and using postman we can send the request to our app and get the output

 #we convert it into list and after getting the pickle file we have to reshape it#

    #(1,-1) because it is a single data point record that we get and take it to do the transformation and it want single record record with so many number of features based on our data set#
    new_data=scaler.transform(np.array(list(data.values())).reshape(1,-1))
